                <h5> Maldives</h5>
                <img class="rounded float-start trip-img" src="pictures/best-islands-maldives.jpg" alt="galapagos">
                The Maldives are home to some of the world's most ravishing islands, but it's the sea, which truly makes these islands shine.
                Luminous aquamarine waters with crystal clarity lap upon these dazzling white shores, which barely peek above the Indian Ocean.
                The Maldives are also famous for their [overwater bungalows](https://www.planetware.com/maldives/best-overwater-bungalows-ind-1-33.htm),
                where you can enjoy the calm clear waters from the comfort of your accommodation.
                Consisting of 26 natural atolls,
                the Maldives archipelago is the planet's lowest-lying nation,
                with the highest point no more than three meters above the sea, a measurement that shrinks every year.

                <h5>Bora Bora, French Polynesia</h5>
                <img class="rounded float-start trip-img" src="pictures/best-islands-bora-bora.jpg" alt="theWhitsundayIslands">
                Shaped like a giant sombrero, this lush volcanic island stars in countless South Pacific fantasies.
                The focal point and best asset of this tropical beauty is its ravishing lagoon in technicolor turquoise.
                Fish, turtles, sharks, and rays swim in the clear waters, and tiny islets or motus dot the lagoon.
                The island, of course, is distinctly French, with mouthwatering cuisine to match.
                Diving and snorkeling are excellent in the surrounding reefs, and hiking trails weave through the palm-studded forests.
                Like the Maldives, Bora Bora is home to luxury resorts and overwater bungalows, where you can fall asleep to the gentle sounds of the sea.

                <img class=" rounded float-start trip-img" src="pictures/most-beautiful-islands-in-the-world-palawan-islands-near-el-nido.jpg" alt="zanzibarIsland">
                The island of Palawan is home to some of the most beautiful beaches in the world and is the Philippines' answer to paradise.
                The most stunning area and what sets this island apart from others are the limestone cliffs and beaches on the north end of Palawan,
                near the town of El Nido. The beaches and views from the town are beautiful, but you can also explore the incredibly scenic Bacuit Bay,
                which is often what you'll see in photos of Palawan.

                <img class="rounded float-start trip-img" src="pictures/best-islands-seychelles.jpg" alt="theGreekIsles">
                Pristine and picture-perfect, the Seychelles are worth traveling for. East of Kenya,
                this relatively unspoiled archipelago of 115 coral and granite islands is packed with attractions,
                from UNESCO-listed jungles and thriving coral reefs to palm-lined, powdery beaches flanked by giant boulders.
                Almost half the total land area of these equatorial isles is protected,
                and many of the islands lie within fish-rich marine sanctuaries with excellent diving and snorkeling.
                The Seychelles also feature some of the planet's richest fishing grounds,
                making this a top destination for anglers. Add some spicy Créole cuisine into the mix, as well as the plush resorts of Mahé, Praslin,
                and La Digue, and it's easy to understand the Seychelles' allure.

                <h5> The Dalmatian Islands, Croatia</h5>
                <img class="rounded float-start trip-img" src="pictures/best-islands-dalmatian-islands.jpg" alt="theAdriaticCoast">
                In the Adriatic Sea off the coast of Croatia, the Dalmatian Islands are an enchanting mix of relaxed charm and rich history.
                Quaint villages and boutique hotels and restaurants dot these gorgeous isles, which are surrounded by sparkling seas and some of the Croatia's best beaches.
                Top on the list is Brac with the famous beach strip of Zlatni Rat (Golden Horn). Hvar is also beautiful,
                with Gothic churches, a car-free old town, and a picturesque fishing harbor. From here, you can zip across to the beautiful Pakleni Islands,
                known for their crystal-clear water and secluded coves.
                Other must-see Dalmatian islands include Korcula, with its red-roofed,
                white-washed buildings; Mljet with its two inland saltwater lakes; and relatively uncrowded Vis.

                <h5> Santorini, Greece</h5>
                <img class="rounded float-start trip-img" src="pictures/best-islands-santorini.jpg" alt="theBayofIslands">
                Encircling a sea-filled caldera, spectacular Santorini scores top points for its dramatic beauty.
                Bleached white villas tumble down volcanic cliffs. Blue-domed churches rise against the sparkling sea,
                and bright sprays of bougainvillea add to the eye-popping color palette.
                Perched atop the black lava cliffs,
                the settlements of Firá and Oia are the island's most picturesque – and pricey, destinations – and Oia ranks among the most photographed locations in the world.
                Other highlights of Santorini include Akrotíri Archaeological Site,
                Ancient Thira, the black sand beach of Perissa, and of course, the sublime sunsets.
                Sailing into this stunning caldera surrounded by soaring sea cliffs makes an unforgettable first impression.

                <h5>The Cook Islands</h5>
                <img class="rounded float-start trip-img" src="pictures/best-islands-cook-islands.jpg" alt="frenchPolynesia">
                If you've ever dreamed of being a castaway in the South Pacific, the Cook Islands are for you.
                Strung between French Polynesia and Samoa but with strong ties to New Zealand,
                the archipelago's 15 islands are among the underrated jewels of the South Pacific.
                Among the islands' top attractions are enticing aquamarine lagoons, palm-fringed beaches,
                and volcanic peaks. Best of all, the locals are among the friendliest in the South Pacific.
                Rarotonga is the main tourist hub, with its many resorts, lush peaks, and plentiful beaches.
                Aitutaki is one of the most beautiful islands in the South Pacific. Hibiscus-laced villages snuggle on the hillsides,
                and 21 motus or small islets lie along its heavenly lagoon, many within kayak distance of the resorts.
                Ensconce yourself here in an over-the-water bungalow,
                or hole up in a rustic beach shack on a remote out island and live your Robinson Crusoe fantasies.

                <h5>Kaua'i, USA</h5>
                <img class="rounded float-start trip-img" src="pictures/best-islands-kauai.jpg" alt="theBritishVirginIslands">
                Kaua'i is called "the Garden Isle" for good reason: rainforests cloak much of the interior, waterfalls tumble from lava cliffs, and the intoxicating fragrance of tropical blooms hangs heavy on the sultry air.
                But the island's beauty lies not just in its luxuriant flora.
                Its spectacular coastline will take your breath away. Lava sculpted this stunning island,
                thrusting up from the ocean floor to form velvety ridges and vertiginous cliffs rimmed by gorgeous beaches.
                Beneath its cobalt-blue seas, turtles and tropical fish swim along coral reefs,
                delighting divers and snorkelers from around the globe. Compared to its popular sister islands, Maui and Oahu,
                Kaua'i exudes a low-key vibe and tends to move at a more relaxed pace.
                Explore the lush mountains and coastal areas on some of Kauai's most popular hiking trails.
                And don't miss Kauai's top attractions: the breathtaking Na Pali Coast, the 10-mile-long Waimea Canyon, and the cloud-capped vistas from the cliffs above Hanalei Bay.

                <h5>St. Lucia, The Caribbean</h5>
                <img class="rounded float-start trip-img" src="pictures/world-most-beautiful-islands-st-lucia-caribbean.jpg" alt="lycianCoast">
                St. Lucia exudes a dark and brooding beauty. Unlike other islands in the Caribbean, its best assets are not necessarily its beaches, though with their golden sands and graceful palms, they are popular with those who visit.
                Rather, the island itself is drenched in topographic drama.
                The towering Pitons, twin volcanic peaks, preside over the luxuriant landscapes,
                rising more than 700 meters from the sea, and providing a breathtaking backdrop to the stunning scenery.
                Bristling forests of coconut palms, waterfalls, quaint fishing villages, coral reefs, nature trails,
                and healing hot springs are just some of the sights to explore on St. Lucia. Pretty Marigot Bay and Anse Chastanet Marine Park are some of the highlights.
                The island's French influences also add to its exotic appeal.
